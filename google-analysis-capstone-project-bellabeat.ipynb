This also suggests that the steps recorded during the week was not as a result of exercise, but from active work.\n* The recommended daily steps for adults (adult women) is between 6,000 to 10,000 steps per day, and we can see that the users recorded far below the recommended steps. This reveals that majority of users are lacking beneficial physical activity.\n\n**Rcommendations**\n* More personal information is needed like the age, mood and state of mind of participants, as these factors help to influence the willingness for physical activity. If this data is available, more insights can be drawn from users.\n* The Bellabeat marketing team should increse campaigns for more weekend physical activity, with incentive for users who exercise more on weekdays. Personalized notifications can be made available to users to help prompt physical activity.\n* This campaigns should encourage meaningful physical activities that are beneficial to the health, and also reduces stress.","metadata":{"_uuid":"240818da-600c-4528-add3-ce86cd1fc1d1","_cell_guid":"27ccbe13-a5f2-4601-b030-19fb21af1a48","trusted":true}}]}
